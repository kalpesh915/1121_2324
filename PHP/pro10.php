            Comments in PHP
            A comment in PHP code is a line that is not executed as a part of the program. Its only purpose is to be read by someone who is looking at the code.
            Comments can be used to:
            1   Let others understand your code
            2   Remind yourself of what you did - Most programmers have experienced coming back to  
                their own work a year or two later and having to re-figure out what they did. Comments can remind you of what you were thinking when you wrote the code
            3   Leave out some parts of your code
