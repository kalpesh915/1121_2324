            PHP Variables
            Variables are "containers" for storing information.
            Creating (Declaring) PHP Variables
            In PHP, a variable starts with the $ sign, followed by the name of the variable:
        */ 

        $ip1 = 10; // quotes are not required
        $user = "Ansh"; //Note: When you assign a text value to a variable, put quotes around the value.
        $city = "Rajkot";

        /*
            Note: Unlike other programming languages, PHP has no command for declaring a variable. It is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
        */ 
    ?>
